## Description
The Basketball Scoreboard project is a simple web application developed as a solo project from Scrimba. It features a countdown timer starting from 60:00 and counting down to 00:00. With an intuitive interface, users can interact with the application by using three buttons: +1, +2, and +3. These buttons allow users to increment the score for either the home team or the guest team with a single click. It provides a good practice opportunity for developing web projects and showcases the use of HTML5, CSS3, and a bit of JavaScript.
